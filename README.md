# MathGen
Python Project to generate genealogical graphs using the data from the Mathematics Genealogy Project

This is a completely new implementation of a project I did in 2019 to generate a poster of a friend's academic family tree as a present for his defense.

## Status
At the moment only the basic functionality of downloading info from the Mathematics Genealogy Project from their website and storing this data in a SQLite3 database is implemented.
